# Unit Test Workflow
# This workflow runs Jest unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality
# Documentation: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
#
# Purpose: Automatically run unit tests on push and pull requests to catch
# bugs and regressions before they reach the main branch.
#
# Test Framework: Jest with jsdom environment for browser simulation
#
# How to add/run tests:
# - Add test files in the __tests__ directory with .test.js extension
# - Run locally: npm test (requires npm install first)
# - Run with coverage: npm run test:coverage
# - Run in watch mode: npm run test:watch
#
# Test file naming conventions:
# - __tests__/*.test.js
# - __tests__/*.spec.js
#
# Maintenance: Keep Jest updated via dependabot or manual updates in package.json
