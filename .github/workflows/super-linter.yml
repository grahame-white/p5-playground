# Super-Linter Workflow
# This workflow uses super-linter to enforce code quality standards across the repository
# Documentation: https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter
#
# Purpose: Automatically lint all code changes on push and pull requests to ensure
# consistent code style and catch common errors before they reach the main branch.
#
# Configured linters:
# - JavaScript (ESLint)
# - HTML (HTMLHint)
# - CSS (Stylelint)
# - Markdown (markdownlint)
# - YAML (yamllint)
#
# Maintenance: Update the super-linter version periodically to get new linters and fixes.
# Check releases at: https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter/releases
